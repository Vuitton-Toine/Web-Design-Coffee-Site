	<h1>Seriously Strong Coffee.</h1>
	<p>In 2012, Death Wish Coffee Co. started in a small coffee shop in Saratoga Springs, NY. Founder Mike Brown saw a need for coffee that was both strong and delicious to serve his groggy morning customers. After creating the perfect blend of beans and combining it with his unique roasting technique, the 'World's Strongest Coffee' was born. Today, thousands of people trust Death Wish Coffee to wake them up and keep them going every day. </p>

	<h1>Our Mission</h1>
	<p>Our mission is to fuel you wherever you go. Death Wish Coffee is made by passionate people for passionate people, and our carefully selected, perfectly roasted coffee beans produce a bold, highly caffeinated coffee blend. We strive for the best tasting and highest quality organic and fair trade beans in every bag. Our processes are USDA certified and we have committed to sustainability throughout our products.

		<h1>Our Actions</h1>
	<p>In 2015, we won Intuit’s ‘Small Business Big Game’ competition, which gave us a 30-second commercial spot during the Super Bowl. Since then, our business has grown every day, allowing us to reach more coffee drinkers than ever before. We were the official coffee sponsor of New York Comic Con, we’ve sponsored NASCAR Drivers Ty Dillon and Daniel Hemric, and we’ve had the opportunity to support amazing charities like the Special Olympics with our products. We also continue to release limited edition merchandise such as apparel and mugs to make sure the Death Wish brand fits into every aspect of our community's lives. And now, Death Wish Coffee is on thousands of store shelves — find the store closest to you here.</p></div>
